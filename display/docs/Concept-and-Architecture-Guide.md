About Terracotta Documentation

<div class="confluence-information-macro-body">

This documentation is about Terracotta DSO, an advanced distributed-computing technology aimed at meeting special clustering requirements.

Terracotta products without the overhead and complexity of DSO meet the needs of almost all use cases and clustering requirements. To learn how to migrate from Terracotta DSO to standard Terracotta products, see [Migrating From Terracotta DSO](https://confluence.terracotta.org/display/docs/Migrating+From+Terracotta+DSO). To find documentation on non-DSO (standard) Terracotta products, see [Terracotta Documentation](http://terracotta.org/documentation). Terracotta release information, such as release notes and platform compatibility, is found in [Product Information](https://confluence.terracotta.org/display/release/Home).
