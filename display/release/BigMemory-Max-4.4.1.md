summary:
---

BigMemory Max delivers ultrafast access to hundreds of terabytes of in-memory data. BigMemory snaps into enterprise applications to deliver unmatched performance at any scale.

BigMemory Max supports a distributed in-memory data-storage topology, which enables the sharing of data among multiple caches and in-memory data stores in multiple JVMs. It uses a Terracotta Server Array to manage data that is shared by multiple application nodes in a cluster.

The Ehcache 2.11.1.x API can be used with BigMemory Max 4.4.1.x as a general-purpose cache/in-memory data store or a second-level cache for Hibernate. You can additionally integrate it with third-party products such as ColdFusion, Google App Engine, and Spring.

# Important Upgrade Information
-------
The following information is contained in the readme.txt file included with each fix release and should be reviewed prior to applying any fix.
<br>
```
8.0 Installation

8.1 Shut down the server array. A safe shutdown procedure is as follows.

    a. Shut down the mirror servers using the stop-tc-server script. 
       If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the mirror servers, execute the wrapper shut
       down command to shut down the mirror servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.

    b. Shut down the clients. A terracotta client will shut down when you shut down your application.

    c. Shut down the active servers using the stop-tc-server script.
       If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the servers, execute the wrapper shut down
       command to shut down the servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.

8.2 This fix overwrites server scripts,wrapper configuration files and default tc-config.xml. If
    you have any custom settings defined on those files (ex:MaxDirectMemorySize), then you need to
    restore those settings back after applying the fix.

8.3 Install using Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at
    https://docs.webmethods.io/.

8.4 The upgrade of the 3rd party library Shiro may create an issue for some users that will require
    a manual configuration change to the "shiro.ini" found in the ".tc/mgmt" directory of the
    user's home folder (the user that the TMS/TMC process runs as ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini). Edit this
    file and restart the TMS/TMC.
     
    a. Blank browser page or a message from the browser indicating too many redirects, or similar.
       In [urls] section of file ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini, locate the line in the that reads
       "/login.jsp = authc". Immediately above that line add the three following lines:

       /401.jsp = anon
       /403.jsp = anon
       /404.html = anon
      
       In the [main] section of file ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini, add the following line:
      
       [main]
       shiro.filterOncePerRequest=true
   
    b. URLs containing semi-colon are blocked and 400 client error is thrown. 
       In the [main] section of file ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini, add the following two lines to the top
       of the section:

       [main]
       invalidRequest = org.apache.shiro.web.filter.InvalidRequestFilter
       invalidRequest.blockSemicolon = false

    c. Previously, secure cookies in TMS were enabled by default, working only with TLS-secured 
       connections or localhost requests. Remote HTTP access required adding the following line to 
       the ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini file:
       
       [main]
       securityManager.sessionManager.sessionIdCookie.secure = false
       
       The default value for this setting is now set to false. A restart of the TMS for changes
       to take effect.

9.0 Uninstallation

    a. Shut down the mirror servers using the stop-tc-server script. 
       If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the mirror servers, execute the wrapper shut
       down command to shut down the mirror servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.

    b. Shut down the clients. A Terracotta client will shut down when you shut down your application.

    c. Shut down the active servers using the stop-tc-server script.
       If you are using a wrapper solution to manage the servers, execute the wrapper shut down
       command to shut down the servers instead of using the stop-tc-server script.

9.2 Uninstall using Update Manager. For instructions, see the documentation at
