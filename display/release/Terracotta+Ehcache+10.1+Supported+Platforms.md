Platform Support
----------------

As a 100% Java solution, Terracotta should run without issues on Java platforms for which it is not certified as well. If you have any questions about a certified or non-certified platform, contact us in one of the following ways:

Terracotta is comprised of two different components: the client that integrates with your application, and the server (the server array) that typically runs on a set of separate machines in production.  The client is designed to run on many platform/JDK/container combinations. The server runs directly as a Java process (without a container).
