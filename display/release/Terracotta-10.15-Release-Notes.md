Fixes are cumulative from version to version.

# Feature Highlights
------------------
The Terracotta 10.15 release builds upon the enterprise readiness features and analytical capabilities of past releases, by improving operational usability and performance. Some of the notable features of Terracotta 10.15 include:

* Requires Java 17
* Spring Framework 6.x
* Support for RedHat EL9 (server)
* Support for Windows Server 2022
* Dataset import-export functionality  
* Provide logs in JSON format for better searchability and performance.
* Docker images with Logging as a service (LaaS) support
* Voter process now available with Docker image
* Various bug fixes and security fixes
* Dataset import-export functionality can be exported to both Parquet and TSON file formats.  Data from a TSON-formatted file can be imported into a dataset (Parquet import not supported).  The import-export operations can be performed through a new CLI import-export tool or through an end-user built client making use of the new import-export library.
