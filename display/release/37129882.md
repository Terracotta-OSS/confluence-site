Platform Support
----------------

The platforms listed on this page are currently certified for use with commercial Terracotta product editions. As a 100% Java solution, Terracotta should run without issues on Java platforms for which it is not certified as well. If you have any questions about a certified or non-certified platform, contact us in one of the following ways:  
  

*   Send email to [info@terracotta.org](mailto:info@terracotta.org)
*   Post a question on our community forums

Terracotta is comprised of two different components: the client that integrates with your application, and the server (the server array) that typically runs on a set of separate machines in production. Â The client is designed to run on many platform/JDK/container combinations. The server runs directly as a Java process (without a container).

### If you are using Sun SPARC

You may be encountering a known issue with the Sun Hotspot JVM for SPARC. The problem is expected to occur with Hotspot 1.6.0\_08 and higher, but may have been fixed in a later version. For more information, see this [Sun bug report](http://bugs.sun.com/bugdatabase/view_bug.do?bug_id=6849574) and [this possible fix](http://hg.openjdk.java.net/jdk7/hotspot-comp/hotspot/rev/c6386080541b).
