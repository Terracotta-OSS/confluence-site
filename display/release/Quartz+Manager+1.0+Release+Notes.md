### Quartz Manager 1.0.0

##### Overview

Quartz Manager provides enterprise-class monitoring and management capabilities for use in both development and production. It provides access to one or more Quartz Scheduler instances from a single web console. The application runs either as a Java web app in your own container (such as Tomcat), or as a standalone Java app with its own Jetty container. The app functions as a JMX client to the remote Quartz Schedulers. The web user interface is an Adobe Flex client application that runs in web browsers with an Adobe FlashPlayer plug-in.

*   View status and details, pause, resume and shutdown schedulers

Note: some features, such as the ability to schedule triggers, and to add and schedule job in a single step - as described in the product documentation packaged with the product - require Quartz 2.0
