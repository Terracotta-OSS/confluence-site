Understanding Terracotta Kit Names and Version Numbers
------------------------------------------------------

Kit names include the kit content (whether it is an individual product/project - such as Ehcache - or a full Terracotta kit), a version, and possibly some additional attributes.

Terracotta kits have a version number that in general refers to the platform version.

A kit version number can also have one of the following attributes to indicate its purpose or a change other than to the platform:

*   \_ (Underscore) – A kit containing the same platform as the non-underscore version but at least one major Terracotta component with a version change. Major components are Ehcache, Quartz Scheduler, Sessions, and the Toolkit. For example Terracotta 3.4.0\_1 is identical to Terracotta 3.4.0 except that Ehcache 2.3.0 was replaced with Ehcache 2.3.1.
*   ee – Included in the name indicates that this is an Enterprise Edition product release (a commercial version that requires a license to run) as opposed to an Open Source project release.
*   Beta – A pre-release kit intended for beta testing.
*   RC (Release Candidate) – A kit that is a candidate to become the final release unless issues are discovered that must be fixed before a final release is made. A release candidate is suitable for late-stage testing.
*   SNAPSHOT – Snapshots reflect the code as it currently exists, and are not official releases. Snapshot kits can change daily and may have functional and performance issues. For example, Terracotta 3.5.0-SNAPSHOT may be suitable for early testing purposes, but is not recommended for POCs.
*   patch – A patch to an ee (Enterprise Edition) kit. See below for more details.

Patches are a provided for ee (Enterprise Edition) kits for commercial customers only. For more information on using software patches, see [Patches](Patches).
