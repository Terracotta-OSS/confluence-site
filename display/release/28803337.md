Platform Support
================

The platforms listed on this page are currently certified for use with commercial Terracotta product editions. As a 100% Java solution, Terracotta should run without issues on Java platforms for which it is not certified. If you have any questions about a certified or non-certified platform, contact us in one of the following ways:

*   Send email to [info@terracotta.org](mailto:info@terracotta.org)
*   Post a question on our [community forums](http://forums.terracotta.org)

Terracotta is comprised of two different components: the **client** that integrates with your application, and the **server** (the server array) that typically runs on a set of separate machines in production.

The client is designed to run on many platform/JDK/container combinations. The server runs directly as a Java process (without a container).

Client JDKs
===========

For standard usage (also referred as Express integration) - via standard application libraries - with Ehcache, Quartz and Web Sessions, the following JDK's are supported:

| 
JDK Version

 |
| --- |
| 

Sun Hotspot 1.5.0\_22

 |
| 

Sun Hotspot 1.6.0\_30

 |
| 

Oracle BEA JRockit 1.6.0\_26-b03 R28

 |
| 

IBM JDK 1.5

 |
| 

IBM JDK 1.6

 |

Custom/DSO Usage

*   In addition to the ability to integrate Terracotta via standard application libraries (Ehcache, Quartz and Web Sessions), Terracotta also supports a Custom/DSO (Distributed Shared Objects) integration mode. Custom/DSO provides support for additional advanced use cases via lower level JVM-level data type clustering. It is typically only used for direct JVM-level POJO clustering (without using Ehcache), or uses cases that combine Ehcache with explicit DSO clustering of other data types in a single application, or when using Ehcache in non-serialized identity mode.
*   For more information on integration and installation modes, see our
    
*   Custom/DSO usage is only supported with the Sun Hotspot JDK - as it relies on a JDK specific boot-jar for byte-code manipulation. Additionally, Websphere is not support with Custom/DSO usage.
