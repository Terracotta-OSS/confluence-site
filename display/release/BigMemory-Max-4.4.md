BigMemory Max delivers ultrafast access to hundreds of terabytes of in-memory data. BigMemory snaps into enterprise applications to deliver unmatched performance at any scale.

BigMemory Max supports a distributed in-memory data-storage topology, which enables the sharing of data among multiple caches and in-memory data stores in multiple JVMs. It uses a Terracotta Server Array to manage data that is shared by multiple application nodes in a cluster.

The Ehcache 2.x API can be used with BigMemory Max 4.x as a general-purpose cache/in-memory data store or a second-level cache for Hibernate. You can additionally integrate it with third-party products such as ColdFusion, Google App Engine, and Spring.
