Created by Subhashni Anuradha, last modified by Fiona OShea on Sep 28, 2021

BigMemory Max 4.3.9 (April 2021) is the latest release. It includes Ehcache 2.10.9.

Fixes are cumulative from version to version.

### **Deprecation Notices  
**

Software AG intends to deprecate and remove from distribution the WAN Replication Service/Module in the next release (4.3.10, late 2021).

Software AG intends to deprecate the Web Sessions product in the next release (4.3.10, late 2021).

  

**New Features  
**
-------------------

BigMemory Max 4.3.0 introduced following new capabilities:

1.  Terracotta Management Console (TMC) extended to support WAN Replication Service: The WAN tab enables monitoring of information about the following aspects of the WAN Replication Service:
    1.  WAN's topology and configuration information
    2.  Performance statistics and details of their deployment, such as the orchestrator topology, configuration, and status of each WAN-enabled cache. 
2.  Support for Java 8
3.  Support for RedHat EL7 (server)
4.  Ability to restrict TMC access to execute adhoc(BigMemory) SQL (BigMemory 4.3.1)
5.  Support for SUSE Linux Enterprise 12 (BigMemory 4.3.1)
6.  A simpler version (IP whitelist) of access restrictions has been added (restricting access to a list of provided IP addresses) (BigMemory 4.3.2)
7.  Failover Tuning – Data consistency for cross-data center clustering (BigMemory 4.3.3)
8.  Support for Tomcat 8 (BigMemory 4.3.3)
9.  Quartz no longer supported (BigMemory 4.3.3)
10.  Added Docker to Terracotta kit for SAG Install (BigMemory 4.3.4)
11.  Support for Windows Server 2016 (BigMemory 4.3.4)

### Summary of Changes in 4.3.9

####        New in Terracotta BigMemory 4.3.9

*   Java 11 officially supported (along with Java 8)
*   Command Central SPM Plugin:  Secured connections (SSL/TLS) now supported.

####      Security Updates to Third Party Libraries

*   7857 - Shiro component updated to version 1.7.0.
*   7913 - Bootstrap updated to version 4.5.2.
*   7898 - Jetty updated to version 9.4.35.
*   Various other 3rd party library updates

####       Resolved

*   7912 - Terracotta Management Console (TMC) Offline Data panel fails to initialize when security enabled and the username contains special characters.
*   7903 - Terracotta Management Console (TMC) not displaying Caching Clients Information correctly. 

####      Notes

     The upgrade of 3rd party library Shiro creates an issue that will require a configuration change for some users.  URLs containing semi-colon are blocked and 400 client error is thrown.

      To solve this issue, add the following 2 lines if they don't exist already at the very top under the \[main\] section of file ~/.tc/mgmt/shiro.ini

\[main\]
invalidRequest = org.apache.shiro.web.filter.InvalidRequestFilter
invalidRequest.blockSemicolon = false

  

### Summary of Changes in 4.3.8

#### New in Terracotta BigMemory 4.3.8

*   Logging moved from (directly) "log4j" framework to "logback".

#### Resolved

*   7589 - Remove misleading warning during election
*   7686 - Resolve issue with remaining lock file preventing start of TMS/TMC
*   7760 - Optional TC property "http.enable.socket.reclaimer" introduced to enable forced extra attempts to close sockets that have encountered connectivity errors
*   7762 - Silence unnecessary logging noise

#### Known Issues

*   4984 - Port 9540 is no longer valid.  Actual IP address will show versus the loopback one.
*   5477 - When user kills Master Orchestrator and Replica Orchestrator, some caches in Region 1 return "OrchestratorAlive" to be "true".

#### Notes

Users who have previously configured authentication settings for the TMS/TMC may need to make a manual file edits in order to be able to log in after applying fixes. The symptom of this need is a blank browser page or a message from the browser indicating too many redirects, or similar.  
To fix the problem edit the "shiro.ini" found in the ".tc/mgmt" directory of the user's home folder (the user that the TMS/TMC process runs as). In this text file locate the line (typically near the bottom) that reads "/login.jsp = authc". Immediately above that line, add the three following lines if they are not present:

/401.jsp = anon 
/403.jsp = anon 
/404.html = anon
